                        <p>An interactive web platform that provides absolutely free educational resources for learning languages. The main feature is not the language itself and the methodology, but the traditions and cultural heritage that created the semantic features of languages ​​and built associations for the next verb form. I believe that the associative approach is the best in the learning process, so LANGUTORO makes things.</p>
