                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>Throughout my career, I have been surrounded by various digital business solutions for data analysis provided by Microsoft (MS Office), and I have diverse experience with ERP systems both in Poland and Belarus. I also feel comfortable in teaching, expanding the learning experience, which I demonstrated during my part-time work as a lecturer. By independently continuing education in IT, developing my own learning platform, I will be able to provide it to more people around the world and bring them closer together.</p>

                    <h3>Langutoro</h3>
                    <p>An interactive web platform that provides absolutely free educational resources for learning languages. The main feature is not the language itself and the methodology, but the traditions and cultural heritage that created the semantic features of languages ​​and built associations for the next verb form. I believe that the associative approach is the best in the learning process, so LANGUTORO makes things.</p>

                    <p>After working with ERP systems, databases and writing research papers on intellectual property rights protection during my university studies, I wanted to dive deeper into digitalization and software development. <br>
                        Started from the very beginning: basic concepts of computer science (digital information, programming, internet technologies, discrete mathematics). I am discovering web development and plan to dive deeper into backend development, database management and the CI/CD approach. I also want to start expanding my knowledge in developing more specific and complex systems, such as SAP ERP Systems.</p>
